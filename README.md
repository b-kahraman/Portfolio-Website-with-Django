## 🔧 Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bkahraman-python/Portfolio-Website-with-Django.git
cd Portfolio-Website-with-Django
```

### 2. Create Virtual Environment

**Windows:**

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

### 4. Set Up Database

The SQLite database will be created automatically when you run migrations:

```bash
python3 manage.py makemigrations
python3 manage.py migrate
```
**Note:** The `db.sqlite3` file is automatically generated and should not be committed to version control. Make sure it's listed in your `.gitignore` file.

```bash
python3 manage.py createsuperuser
```
Enter your username, email, and password when prompted.

### 6. Collect Static Files

```bash
python3 manage.py collectstatic
```

### 7. Environment Variables

You must create a `.env` file in the project root.  
The project will not work without this file.

Use the template below as a starting point.  
Replace the placeholder values with your own credentials.

```env
# Django Secret Key → MUST be changed!
SECRET_KEY=replace_this_with_a_real_secret_key
# Generate a secure one:
# python -c "from django.core.management.utils import get_random_secret_key; print(get_random_secret_key())"

# Development mode
IS_DEV=True

# Local development
APP_HOST=127.0.0.1

# ───────────────────────────────
# Gmail SMTP Configuration

# 4. Copy the 16-digit password (ignore spaces) and paste here
